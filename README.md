# GhostFinder

Just a tiny helper tool for Phasmophobia written in HTML and JS.

How to use:

 - hovering over a ghost will highlight the evidence needed to identify it
 - clicking on a clue will turn it green to indicate that the clue is present, click it again to turn it red and indicate that the clue is not present; ghosts will be filtered accordingly
 - click on a behavioural clue to highlight both the ghost to which the behavioural clue refers to and the clues needed to identify it

Yup, it's not great. It's poorly written, but I'm sleep deprived and I just wanted something that worked. I'll clean up later.
